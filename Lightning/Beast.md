## 1. Getting the necessary files 
You need:
-2 folders from Unreal Tournament 3 (wxRC and wxRes)
-The wxRes folder from the 2008 beta build of Mirror's Edge
-The Turtle folder, which can be found in the beta build too

You can find the above files in the Mirror's Edge Modding Discord server

## 2. Replacing files
Drag the 2 folders (wxRC and wxRes) from UT3 to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\mirrors edge\Binaries` or wherever your Mirror's Edge game is located. After that, drag the wxRes folder from beta build to the same directory and replace files. Now previously missing icons will be present (mainly icons of Beast).
