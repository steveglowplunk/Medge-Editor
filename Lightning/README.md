## 1. Getting the necessary files 
You need 2 folders fom Unreal Tournament 3. Those folders are wxRC and wxRes. Once you got those folders, you need the wxRes from the beta build of Mirror's Edge. Which can be found in the Modding community on Discord. There you can find the two folders from Unreal Tournament 3 too.

## 2. Replacing files
Now drag the 2 folders from UT3 to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\mirrors edge\Binaries` or whatever your mirror's edge game is located. After that, drag the wxRes folder from beta build in the same location as before and replace files. Now you will have new icons.
